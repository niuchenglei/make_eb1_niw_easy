\enquote{\ul{Mr. LastName's exceptional work as a machine learning engineer has significantly bolstered Xxx's leadership in the AVOD sector.} Waiving the PERM to such exemplary professionals serves the national interests of the United States and will not hurt the US labor market.} \referrerA



In conclusion, the initial evidence presented in Sections 1 and 2 and in the attached Exhibits shows that \dr has a degree of expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered in \fie{}. \\

\dr is a well-recognized expert in the industrial and scientific field of \fie{}. He will continue working in the field of his expertise in the United States. Supporting letters from experts in the field state that \drs activity in industrial form and open-source community would benefit the United States in industrial, academic, and environmental applications. \\


Because of his record of successful achievement in the area of national importance, \dr offers contributions of such value that, on balance, they would benefit the United States even assuming that other qualified U.S. workers are available. The requirement of the lengthy process of obtaining the labor certification would interrupt and delay the work being performed by \dr and would have a negative impact on the national interests of the United States.
Thus, \dr fully satisfies all requirements and regulations listed in INA Section 203(b)(2) and I ask the reviewer to approve \drs petition for the permanent residence under the category of an alien of exceptional ability with the national interest waiver. \\

\subsection*{Statement from Mr. Xxx LastName detailing plans on how he intends to continue work in the United States}

\today\\


My name is Xxx LastName, the recipient of the I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, seeking EB2-NIW immigrant classification based on exceptional ability in \fie{}. With over a decade of dedicated service in the technology industry, I have contributed significantly to top-tier tech companies over the world. I have influenced numerous professionals across various companies through active engagement in industry forums and impactful presentations. Furthermore, startups and leading tech corporations have widely embraced my open-source projects. Additionally, my publications of papers and patents have helped fortify the nation's and companies' competitive advantages. \\


Currently I reside in the Bay Area work for Xxx Inc, as a Xxx at Xxx, I contribute to delivering top-tier streaming video experience to our users, and my mainly work is leverage \fie{} technology to improve user's homescreen movie recommendation result. With extensive expertise in the fields of \fie{} and Artificial Intelligence, I aim to further my research and development endeavors in these domains within the United States. \\


If I can get a permanent residence permit in the United States, it can help me easily do the research and development for the state, and Silicon Valley has many meetups around technology, I could be more actively engage these meetups, share what I've learned, and push industrial technology development. Also, being in the United States would let me be more involved in the open-source community cause it will make it easier to work with others in the open-source community and learn more about their pain points, thus iterating the open-source problem and helping more people, thus keep US advance in AI. But without a permanent residence permit, these things would be harder to do. \\ 


My research and work plan in the next two years is to focus on three aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participate in technical conferences and entrepreneurial conferences in the field of \fie{} and AI, know more technical peers, and conduct technical exchanges with them. In November Xxx, I participated in the AI conference initiated by Sky9 Venture Capital, held by many AI Founders(LanceDB Founder, MindsDB Founder, etc.), technicians, and capital investors have collided with them and come up with many entrepreneurial ideas and plans, which shows that I am actively participating in exchanges in the AI field in the United States. \cite{ai_happy_hour}

    \item In terms of serving at Xxx, I will prioritize page-level optimization, aiming to provide users with personalized video recommendations at the page level rather than on individual videos alone. Addressing this challenge will greatly enhance Xxx's competitiveness, especially against competitors like TikTok and Netflix, helping Xxx maintain its position as a leading video streaming platform globally, thereby contributing to the leadership of the United States in the field.

    \item Regarding academics, I plan to finish a paper by the end of 2024. This paper proposes a novel method for modeling embeddings across various scales by introducing several fixed base operators and applying non-linear to those base operators, which significantly reduces the convergence time.
\end{enumerate}


In the next five years, I plan to co-found a company dedicated to providing machine learning algorithm services. Such services have already appeared on the market. A typical example is Databricks, which provides algorithms, computing, and data support, but with the development of AI technology, especially the emergence of ChatGPT, the demand for AI from both individuals and enterprises is different from the past because we are confident that our ideas can have a place in the market. \\

As for the plan for the next ten years, things are unpredictable, and I cannot make too many plans ahead. However, there is no doubt that I will continue to work hard in the field of \fie{} and Artificial Intelligence and promote the development of industrial applications and open-source communities. \\ 

I will be very grateful if I am given a chance to benefit the US science and economy given my expertise in \fie{} and Artificial Intelligence.\\
